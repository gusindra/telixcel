// NOTE: The class `.offcanvas-panel` has been removed because it no longer has any
// style rules, and because `activator.js` looks for and finds `-panel` in the
// modifier classes anyway. However, for sake of consistency with other components,
// we will still retain `offcanvas-panel` in the HTML -- it’s easier not to learn and
// teach that `offcanvas-panel` is an “exception to the rule” of Activator components.
